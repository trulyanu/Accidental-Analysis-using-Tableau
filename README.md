The decrease in the number of people killed in road accidents is encouraging, but there is still more work to be done to make roads safer.
The increase in the number of people seriously injured in road accidents is concerning. This suggests that more people are sustaining serious injuries, even if the number of deaths is decreasing.
The fact that the most common type of road accident is a collision on a single carriageway suggests that more needs to be done to improve safety on these roads.
The fact that the most common time for road accidents is between 4 pm and 6 pm suggests that this is a time when people are more likely to be tired and distracted.
